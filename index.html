        <h3>WEEK 2 JAVASCRIPT BASICS</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</dt>
            <dd>The last couple weeks I became comfortable with command line/html. Im still trying to understand CSS but I feel confident enough that I can play around without breaking anything. At first, javascript seemed untouchable but im SLOWLY warming up to the different things it will do.</dd>
            <dt>STRUGGLES</dt>
            <dd>While I understand what (simple) functions do individually, Im confused on how to take multiple functions to create something bigger. Im also struggling to break something down into small steps and working with each step one at a time. Throw in a parameter or two and im totally lost.</dd>
